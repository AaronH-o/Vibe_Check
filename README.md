## Introduction

Our app is a music playlist and rating website that allows a user to create an account and then create playlists from a list of popular music.

## Problem

We wanted to make a site that lets us create playlists, share them and get introduced to other userâ€™s playlists, because as an avid music connoisseur, we want to expand our exposure to new music so that we can listen to new music that is similar to our current tastes but are as yet unknown to us.

## Solution

We created an application that allows for playlist creation and rating, by users that are logged in. Future functionality should include the ability to edit a created playlist, coneection to an outside API for an expansive song list, and a music player.

Here are some screeenshots of our application:
